# Hand Sign Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying hand signs using deep learning techniques. It can be used for applications like sign language recognition, gesture-based control systems, and more. The model is trained to recognize a set of predefined hand signs from images.

---

## Features
- **Real-time Hand Sign Detection**: Detect hand signs from live video streams.
- **Custom Training**: Train the model on your own dataset for specific hand signs.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and video stream handling.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.

---
